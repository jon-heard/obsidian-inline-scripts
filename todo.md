### Pre-next release

### Next release
/ Make "state" automatically store state un closing and opening Obsidian.
/ make shortcuts case insensitive
/ make dragging work on mobile
/ Add a message to button settings that the prefix/postfix aren't necessary
/ Make new video for the basic state tutorial

### Release after that
- Update the "cards" system based on the pre-release (https://github.com/jon-heard/obsidian-inline-scripts/discussions/36)
	- look into not loading the entire image just to get the aspect ratio
- Adding more options for shortcut links

### Post-next release
- library - write an sfile for ironsworn
- Shift from beta to release (after making either a D&D system or Ironsworn system)
- plugin - typescript - use HTMLElement type wherever possible
- Have shortcut autocomplete react to parameter types (when they are provided by the syntax string)
- Find a way to allow the prefix & suffix to contain auto-closed characters - `{`, `"`, etc
